<p><h1>BAKED ZITI PIZZA</h1></p>
<P>Preparation
<p><h3>To Make the Vegan Parmesan:</h3></p>
<h3><p>*Add all ingredients into the food processor and pulse until crumbly and combined.
<p>To Make the Ziti:</p>
<p>*Heat oven to 425°F degrees. If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to warm up. A regular cookie sheet will also work but no need to warm that up. Cook pasta until al dente, or 2 minutes less than the suggested cooking time. Reserve 1/4 cup cooking water, then drain pasta.</p>
<p>*Heat large sauté pan over medium heat. Coat with some olive oil and heat oil. Add the onion, garlic, mushrooms, oregano, pepper flakes, basil, and salt over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes stirring frequently. Add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
<p>*Add crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Add the tomato paste and the 1/4 cup reserved pasta water. Stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste. Stir in drained pasta and heat together for one minute.
To Make the Pizza:</p>
<p>*Par-bake the pizza crust for 3-4 minutes. This is to help the bottom and the crust get a little crunchy action going on — if you do not do this the pizza crust will remain soft.</p>
<p>*Then top with the pizza with marinara sauce and the mozzarella cheese and put back in the over for another 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted (the melt time will vary depending on what vegan cheese you are using). It's important to get pizza or marinara sauce that is thick, if its too watery the pizza crust will not get crunchy. If needed, you can strain the sauce to remove some excess liquid before topping on the pizza.</p>

<h1>CHICKEN AND ONION PIZZA</h1>
<H3><P>*Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.</P>
<P>*To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil. Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with 1/2 cup BBQ sauce. </P><P>*Toss the cooked chicken with the remaining BBQ sauce, then scatter all around the pizza. Add the cheeses and red onion.</P>
<P>*Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh cilantro, if desired. Slice hot pizza and serve immediately.</P>
<P>*Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.</P></H3>

<h1>SALAD PIZZA</h1>
<H3><P>*Salad: Chop all your salad ingredients and toss with some dressing. I like when it has a little time to sit and marinate together in the dressing.</P>
<P>*Pizza: Bake your crust for about 5-7 minutes at 375 degrees  to get it crispy. If it needs more time, give it up to 10 minutes. Top with a light layer of sauce and cheese and return to the oven until the cheese is melted.</P>
<P>*Assembly: Top the pizza with the salad. Cut and serve. Yummy!</P>
